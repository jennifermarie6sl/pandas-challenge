Pandas Challenge

For this project I selected the Heroes of Pymoli.  

Basic calculations are performed on the data file.  The data is brought into dataFrames to provide a quick glimpse at the calcualations.  The same data file is sorted and resorted to look for patterns based on purchaser demographics as well as items being purchased. 

Jupyter NoteBoosk was utlized to analyze and sort the data and write the pandas script. 

A few takeaways from the analysis:
    The data set is primarily male.  The age range that makes up the biggest percentage is 15-29, ~78%.  
    While males make up the largest group the Other/Non Disclosed has the highest average purchase price as well as average total purchase per person with female purchasers being a close second.
    
A couple additional datasets that could use some further analysis would be:
    Age per gender
    Qty of purchases (over 1) per gender (Top Spenders segment)
    Correlation between Item price and item profitability?
